Hi! I have created different classes of this code so that it would be understandable for you guys that how is this all working.
Its all based upon simulations, that how everything will work out like
1. How the user will login or create account
2. How he will check the balance, deposit money or withdraw money.
3. What will be the steps he will follow during the creation of his account.
The code is further divided into three different classes so that its easy for you guys.
1. Main Code (All Classes are integrated in that file, Its the final form of the system).
Further Divide into three parts:
1.Main Interface (where you will choose the option to create or login to your account).
2.Account creation class (Account login and everything).
3.Account login (Chech balance, deposit or withdraw methods exists in that).
Thanks for reading. Now you can use the code as you like.
